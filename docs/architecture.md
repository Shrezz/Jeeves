# Architecture

The web UI calls a backend API. The API owns authentication, user ownership checks, policy ingestion, retrieval, claim workflows, approval checks, and final writes. Policy evidence is retrieved only within the authenticated user's selected policy.

Planned persistence is Postgres with pgvector plus persistent file storage. Original policy PDFs and generated packets belong in file storage; policy chunks, claims, messages, and events belong in Postgres. Agents prepare answers and drafts; backend action handlers enforce calculations, state changes, approval-version checks, and duplicate-action protection.

Langfuse traces should cover the request workflow. The `evals/` runner should call the same backend service path used by the application.
